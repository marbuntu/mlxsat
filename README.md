## Custom Satellite Setup
The custom Satellite Setup enables the configuration of a realistic spacecraft featuring multiple terminals, each with unique characteristics. The antenna model accurately calculates AoA (Angle of Arrival) and AoD (Angle of Departure) angles based on the terminals' positions and the spacecraft's current orientation.

## Stack

The models are designed to operate with the IPv4 stack of ns-3, enabling the simulation of well-known protocols in large satellite networks or the testing of new ones.
